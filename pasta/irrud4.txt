I'd really rather you didn't indulge in conduct that offends yourself, or your
willing, consenting partner of legal age and mental maturity. As for anyone who might object,
I think the expression is go fuck yourself, unless they find that offensive
in which case they can turn off the TV for once and go for a walk for a change.
