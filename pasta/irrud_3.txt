I'd really rather you didn't judge people for the they look, or how they dress,
or the way they talk, or, well, just place nice, okay? Oh, and get this in your thick heads:
woman equals person. Man equals person. Samey-samey. One is not better than the other,
unless we're talking about fashion and I'm sorry, but I gave that to women and
some guys who know the difference between teal and fuchsia.
