I'd really rather you didn't do unto others as you would have them do unto you
if you are into, um, stuff that uses a lot of leather, lubricant, Las Vegas.
If the other person is into it, however (pursuant to IRRUD 4), then have at it,
take pictures, and for the love of Mike, wear a condom!
Honestly, it's a piece of rubber. If I didn't want it to feel good when you did it
I would have added spikes, or something.
