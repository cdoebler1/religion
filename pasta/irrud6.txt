I'd really rather you didn't build multimillion dollar churches, temples, mosques,
shrines to my noodly goodness when the money could be better spent on ending poverty,
or curing diseases, or living in peace, loving with passion, and lowering the cost of cable.

I might be a complex-carbohydrate omniscient being, but I enjoy the simple things in life.
I ought to know. I am the creator.
