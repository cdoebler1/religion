You can look, but it can't be seen.
It is a worthy fucking adversary.
You can listen, but it can't be heard.
It is a stonewalling little brat.
You can grasp, but it can't be touched.
It floats away like a magic carpet.
There is no bottom, nor proper nomenclature,
All these in and outs make it a very complicated case.

It is not dark, yet darkness warshes over,
It is not light, yet new shit comes to light:
It is fucking ingenious, yet cannot be understood correctly.
It draws lines in the sand, yet does not split hairs,
It throws out a ringer for a ringer, yet there is no handoff.
It has its story, you have yours, yet both are ludicrous.

Don't live in the past.
Worry about what day it is,
Nor hope to make it to the finals.
In this way, the Dude abides,
As Dudeness has always abided.
