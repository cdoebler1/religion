It is best to be like the Dude.
The Dude takes it easy, and is calmer than you are,
He hangs out in bowling alleys and other places
Where careers slow down a little.

So be like the Dude:
Laying low, upon his rug,
Driving a car with rust coloration,
Helping his lady friend conceive,
Taking any rug in the house,
Patronizing the In-N-Out Burger on Camrose,
Digging your style too,
And ending this thing cheap.
In this way, life goes on,
And worry does not.
