The Dudefathers were fellers so much smarter than ourselves,
That we are like children who wander in the middle of a movie.
Because we are out of our element, we can only dig their style:

Good and thorough, like a worthy fucking adversary,
Bright and flowering like the young men at Khe Sanh and Lan Doc,
Ingenious, like a Swiss fucking watch,
Dark, like a black steer's tookus on a moonless prarie night,
Genuine, like Miller Genuine Draft,
Open, like the most modestly-priced receptacle,
Yet opaque, like a White Russian cocktail.

Those who can take 'er easy while dealing with real reactionaries,
And remain calm while goons micturate on their rug,
Are able to safeguard their basic freedoms.
So everything works out pretty good for them.
