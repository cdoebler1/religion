When a plan gets too complex, everything can go wrong.
Do you see what happens?
Draw a line in the sand, toes will slip over the line.
Put a million dollars in your car, perhaps they will tow it.
Roll your way into the semis, they're gonna fuck you up.
Take any rug in the house, you'll get a crack on the jaw.
Keep the fucking money, they're gonna cut off your johnson.

Instead, say "Fuck it."
That's your answer for everything.
It is the way of the Dude.
