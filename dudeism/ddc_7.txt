Why is bowling eternal?
Because it rolls in cycles.
Similarly, because he has no ends,
The Dude never fails to achieve.

The Dude takes it easy,
And so brother shamuses dig his work.
He say, "ah, fuc it"
And thus nothing is fucked.
Because he is a pacifist,
No harm is visited tenfold upon his head.
Because he does not put himself over the line,
He does not enter a world of pain.
It is only because he gives a shit about the fucking Theory of Everything,
That no one's going to cut his dick off.
