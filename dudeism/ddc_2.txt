When a life of achievement is considered best,
They won't approve of your lifestyle.
When good men and thorough are thoroughly trusted,
Shorts can be slid down with impunity.

Amateurs and achievers are two poles of manhood,
Businessmen and bums both have two pairs of testicles,
Complex and simple get down to cases,
Fair and foul are both over the line,
Strikes and gutters are results of the roll,
Reactionaries and pacifists are both concerned about basic freedoms,
Ups and downs are a dance in the cycle.

So the Stranger controls without authority,
And teaches without cuss words.
He lets all things take 'er easy,
Watches the semifinals, but does not interfere,
Drinks sarsaparilla without seeking something stronger,
And takes comfort where he can.
