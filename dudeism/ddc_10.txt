Can you embrace both Maude and Bunny.
And see them as two sides of the same special lady?
This will help you get down to cases,
And prevent you from no longer digging them.

If you are perfectly calm,
You can be like a little Lebowski on the Way.
If you adhere to a strict drug regimen,
You will be able to keep you mind limber.
If you give a shit about that poor woman,
You will be rescued from being a fucking asshole.

As temptation fall burning into your lap,
Can you just take it easy, man?
As you are made privy to new shit that comes to light,
Can you retain the humility of a fucking amateur?

Both the Dude and the Stranger nurse their beverages
Without becoming addicted to them,
They bowl but do not expect to win,
And they ramble without becoming rambunctious.
People call this "being dude."
It is an incarnation of Dudeness--
It comes to light when you keep your mind limber.
