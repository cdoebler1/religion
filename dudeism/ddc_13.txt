The Dude said:
"Can't be worried about that shit. Life goes on."
The stranger likes his style because he's the man for his time and place.

The stranger said:
"Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear, well, he eats you."
The Dude likes his style because he's got a whole cowboy thing going on.

He who regards himself as part of the whole durn human comedy,
Is able to abide the world.
He who asks the bartender for another Caucasian
Is still racially pretty cool.
Life does not stop and start inconveniently.
This affects all of us: The Royal We,
Down through the generations.
I'm rambling again.
