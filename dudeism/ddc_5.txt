Nihilists are unsentimental,
They believe in nossing,
The Stranger is also unsentimental,
He drifts where the wind catches him,
Nihilists are like a bellows--
Empty, yet full of hot air,
The more they threaten, the more cowardly they seem.
The Stranger also rambles and loses his train of thought,
But tells a purty good story--
There's a literal connection.
It affects all of us, dude.
There is no bottom.
