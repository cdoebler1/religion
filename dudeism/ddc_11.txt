A glass is made of crystal.
But it is the space at its center which lets it become a beverage.
A bowling ball is made of resin,
But it is the holes for you fingers which render it rollable.
A bungalow is made of plaster and plywood
But it is the open door which lets you inside.

Therefor, though it is stuff that people want,
It is space that people need.
